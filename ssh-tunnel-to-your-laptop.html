You need publicly available server with ssh. Publicly it means server with public IP address

For example create 5$ droplet on DigitalOcean

Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Add line at end of the file
GatewayPorts yes

Restart ssh service
service ssh restart


On your laptop, start ssh tunnel
ssh -R 9000:localhost:80 root@public_server_ip_address


From your phone
http://public_server_ip_address:9000

When accessing public_server_ip_address on port 9000 all incoming connections will be redirected to your laptop with port 80
