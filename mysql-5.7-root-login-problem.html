On MySQL version 5.7 can not login in from command line
mysql -u root

Gives error Acced denied

Howerver you can login by sudo
sudo mysql -u root


To fix this
Drop all root users

create user 'root'@'%' identified by '';
grant all privileges on *.* to 'root'@'%';
flush privileges;

Now you can login from command line
mysql -u root
